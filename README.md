# Choreganizer

## Description

A nice little app for coordinating recurring chores shared by several people. The main scheduler is written in Python and runs on a server of your choosing. Data storage is in MongoDB for no reason other than I want an excuse to diddle with it; This could change in later versions.

## Roadmap
- Implement methods for communicating with MongoDB
- Add pub/sub ability and notification system for subscribers
- Add client app for iOS and Android (or a web front end shared between both)
